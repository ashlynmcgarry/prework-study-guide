          <li>Internal style sheet adds CSS rules in the head of the HTML file and only applies to all tagged elements on that page.</li>
          <li>External style sheet applies CSS rules in a seperate file, makes changes easier.</li>

          <li> Declaration: property and value.</li>
          <li>*: applies rule to all page elements</li>
          <li> DRY: do not repeat yourself, reuse or share code to minimise number of lines.</li>
          <li>Block: assigns each img to start on new line.</li>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>; indicates where a statement ends, it's good practice to add it at the end of each statement.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
          <li>String is a sequence of text enclosed in "" or ''.</li>
          <li>Numbers don't have quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Boolean values are true or false, no quoatations marks needed.</li>
          <li>An array allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
          <li>Everything in JavaScript is an object, an object can be anything.</li>
          <li>Comments are marked with */ or // and are ignored by the browser.</li>
          <li>Operators are a math symbol that produces a result based on two values or variables and include +, -, * (multiplication) or / (division).</li>
          <li>Strict equality === tests if two values are equal and of the same type, returns a boolean response.</li>
          <li>Interactivity requires Event handlers, they look for activity in the browser and run code in response.</li>
          <li>Null type is exactly one value 'null', the absense of an object.</li>
          <li>Undefined type is exactly one value 'undefined', is the absense of a value.</li>
          <li>Variable is a named container to store data in code.</li>
          <li>const: variables that cannot be reassigned a value, locks down what the variable will be.</li>
          <li>Variable names must be unique.</li>
          <li>=: Assignment operator that assigns data to be stored in a variable.</li>
          <li>To access a string refer to the variable name.</li>
          <li>Falsy is 0, -0, 0n, " ", null, NaN, undefined or false, everything else is Truthy.</li>
          <li>console.log: Output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>Control flow: Order that a computer executes code in a script, JS runs from the first statement at the top to the last statement at the bottom.</li>
          <li>if(condition): executes a block of code if the condition is true.</li>
          <li>Arrays hold a group of data which is often related in some way.</li>
          <li>Index: Allows us to work with individual peices of data in an array by showing the location of that data within the array.</li>
          <li>First item of an array is always 0 not 1.</li>
          <li>For loop: Uses the predictable patterns of indecies to perform a task on all array items.</li>
          <li>To use a for loop you need an index and number of arrays.</li>
          <li>let: allows reassignment of a variable over time.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains: A starting point, a condition and a statement that allows the array to iterate.</li>
          <li>Function: a set of instructions that tells a computer how to perform a task.</li>
          <li>To execute a function, first define the function then call the function.</li>
          <li>Functions are used to define and reuse blocks of code.</li>
